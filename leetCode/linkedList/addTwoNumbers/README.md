# Problem description
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.<br>
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.<br>
Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.<br>
<br>
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)<br>
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8<br>
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.<br>
<br>
# TIPS
Why this problem is medium difficulty, just a quiet simple recursion problem, if solve it by using recursion function is better
