# Problem description
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.<br>
<br>
Example 1:<br>
<br>
Input: [2,3,-2,4]<br>
Output: 6<br>
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>
<br>
Input: [-2,0,-1]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.<br>
